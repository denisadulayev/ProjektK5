                <p>One of my biggest passions are working out in the gym. I started working out for a little more than 2 years ago. For me, working out is not just about striving to become healthy, but I see it as a place for me to get away from the world and push and challenge myself.</p>

              <div class="section2">
                <p>Another big interest of mine is gaming. What I like about gaming so much is the time i get to spend with my friends playing games that we all enjoy.</p>

                <p>Anime is a new interest of me. The reason I started watching anime was because my friend gave me a recommendation, at first I felt like it was a waste of time, but now as I have gotten into it, I see it a a great way to just relax in the evenings.</p>
